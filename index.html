            <h3>SHORT BIOGRAPHY</h3>
            <p>
            I am a Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington, 
            and a member of the Machine Learning group directed by Prof. Chris H.Q. Ding. My research 
            interests are in the areas of machine learning and Computer Vision. Currently, I am 
            focusing on graph convolutional neural network, neural network based graph embedding and their applications </p>
